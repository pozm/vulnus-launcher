# Vulnus launcher
This is an unofficial launcher for vulnus.

## usage
To use go to the releases and download the most recent one!

## installing versions
to install a version just select which version you want and hit install, once it is done it will allow you to play

## extra functionality
Settings and maps should be able to sync across versions using symlinks.

### notes
In windows symlinks are only allowed to be created by administrators by default. 

This will be fixed in a future commit.

while it is broken you can fix it by enabling developer mode within the windows settings.

## planned features
- [ ] move install directory
- [ ] allow to set maps directory to another using symlinks
- [ ] built in mod support
- [ ] (potentially) map download/install support
