## usage
To use go to the releases and download the most recent one!

## installing versions
to install a version just select which version you want and hit install, once it is done it will allow you to play

## extra functionality
Settings and maps should be able to sync across versions using symlinks.

Macos is now supported using patches to the executable to make it work without you having to do anything.
> modding isn't supported at the moment but may be in the future.

### notes
In windows symlinks are only allowed to be created by administrators by default. 

This will be fixed in a future commit.

while it is broken you can fix it by enabling developer mode within the windows settings.

## planned features
- [x] move install directory
- [ ] allow to set maps directory to another using symlinks
- [x] built in mod support
- [ ] (potentially) map download/install support
